Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Ye billows of blue Hadrias sea,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Say, of the two which was Tattiana?
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Verses and tears et cetera.
Opened the portals of the tomb
He writes upon his parents tomb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: tis foolish to disturb
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And triumphs in career erotic.
What! really going? Tis too bad!
Above the ashes of the dead.
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Wheneer he had an aching head;
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
And gently hovered o'er my head?
But on the third of grove and mead
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
Tis finished. Horrible to read!
No other book had time to read.
Nor slander viciously could spread
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Attentive listened to the lad.
But Lenski, I should be so glad
I was incensed and he was sad.
Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
To all good neighbours sport conduced.
At Lrinas abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
And cares not farther to proceed;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
But I perceive thou dost not heed
He took no more the slightest heed;
She seeks the garden in her need
And all with one accord agreed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
The wedding-day had been arranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed
Just at that time his father died,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
But now our minds are mystified
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Alack! Tattiana, she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And a new diadem supplied.
And not a speck of dirt descried.
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
She never of deception dreamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
A few of different temper deemed,
Onegin was so many deemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Or even, silent and resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Once more to idleness consigned,
Have eer a precious tress consigned,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
O ye whom tender love hath pained
A something somehow have obtained,
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
Love to idealize inclined;
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
His neighbours lowly tomb and mourned
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But this a heinous crime appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Upon the Dons broad pastures bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered;
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
By indolence and languor fired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Tis in your power now, if desired,
How like the billow I desired
The fated nutriment desired;
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Of the romances she preferred,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Onguines speeches I abhorred
He who economy abhorred,
Till proper rings could be procured.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!
At first, but soon became inured
In fact, some people were assured
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
The contact of the foot I raised
In love adventures she was versed,
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
What ails thee, dear?I feel depressed.
But sits in bed with air depressed,
The image of her seal impressed.
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
So she in French herself expressed.
But tremor still her frame possessed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
Not that she had his works perused,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Were to analysis subjected.
And life and fate in turn selected
Tattiana with impatience waited
Vladimir Lenski visited
By Olgas hand distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Lenski as a good match received,
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
A new proprietor arrived,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
When but a boy he Olga loved
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Strictly the Carnival observed,
For first madame his wants observed,
They in a peaceful life preserved
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed
Without the least constraint he bowed.
A scant attendance Lenski showed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In correspondence been allowed.
He with his little maiden played,
At prisoners base she never played.
The deuce with my inside has played.
The drama of my youth was played.
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
In Olgas face no life's displayed.
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Yet was her inmost soul oerjoyed
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Again imagination blazed,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
He found him on the table laid,
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
Beneath her parents eyes the maid
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
Poor Yorick, mournfully he said,
What they in conversation said?
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
Vladimir something curtly said
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
We never loved in days of old,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
An almanac but eight years old.
Had killed me had the like been told.
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Of friends unceremonious would
Existthat their immortal band
With the Well-Wisher in her hand!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Of Africa, ancestral land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
In times gone by thy bare command
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
To see you by our fireside stand,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Oh! nurse, nurse, you dont understand!
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
But finally in wedlock bind.
The young proprietor we find;
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
But what astonished do I find
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
From mere vacuity of mind
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
One image occupied his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind;
A pair; though desolate my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
So uncongenial to my mind,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
(This by command; for it was found,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
The German baker looks around
And by the fiddles rushing sound
Attentive to the echoing sound,
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Debate commanded ample food
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Such is the country custom good;
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Onegin meditative stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
Whither away? Deuce take the bard!
In loves campaigns Onegin heard
A noted fop who gambled hard.
I wont detain you; but tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
He hies unto the Boulevard,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Lo! my Onegin rural lord!
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a word
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of late I have been quite absurd,
No more the music thunders loud,
And never hath our language proud
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
But what a nuisance it will be,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Is still condemned in love to be;
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many entertainments be!
Do notyou mightsuspicious be;
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Inseparable soon they be.
Time will the ravages efface
And physic bring with mournful face,
I never should have seen your face
She who with melancholy face
And then monsieur supplied her place;
Hard by the window took her place.
Why did you visit our poor place?
And after them at headlong pace
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The boy was wild but full of grace.
An ancient lady full of grace.
A print without the pictures grace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
O Rus!Horace
And who the rent-roll of his race
Inheritor of all his race.
And my Eugene the path must trace
Neer trusted to the treacherous ace.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?Tis pleasant, nice,
Euphonious, though I know a spice
And shall adopt some new caprice.
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
Then theyre so innocent of vice,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Again in her ethereal dance?
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Or will my melancholy glance
Upon the stage his weary glance.
The days of love and of romance!
Reviews both dress and countenance,
When people with long countenance
He yawns, averts his countenance,
I heard thy voices resonance
Then would we muse as in a trance,
The heros name too in advance,
He wanders in his indolence;
And natural benevolence,
I yield with a low reverence;
But this adventures consequence
I, after so much eloquence,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
As in a thickets humble shade,
Hid in the gondolas dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak trees shade
There, there, beneath the side-scenes shade
I was for calm existence made,
For our amusement ever made
Nor further comment that night made.
The goddess would a masquerade
Choosing a profitable trade,
Were I like you a bard by trade
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
He promised here this day to ride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
On horseback every day they ride
And soon Onguines door beside
And hastened to his uncles side,
But grown familiar side by side
If thou wert sitting by my side,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
And death before the husband wide
Onegin oped the cupboards wide.
To foreign lands he would allude,
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Then, thenwell, in some solitude
Where long time he in solitude
Since Eugene in that solitude
From henceforth I confide to thee!
By Providences dark decree!
When shall I wing my passage free
Impressed him in the least degree,
Perchance he will to all the three.
His valet brings him letters three.
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
And a guitar produced we see,
Virgins miraculous I see,
The giddy world at last shall see.
Whither shall he go first? Hell see,
The break of day she doth not see,
The letter is the thing, you see,
Who floats contentedly through life,
Rural Life
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Or better,like a faithful wife.
By children and by faithful wife
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
With humble prose I'll fill my page
Thus having braved Apollos rage
For two whole days it seemed a change
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
A paragon of virtue he!
Three mortal hours per diem he
And by a sweet delusion he
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
And in her native language she
Nor on the letter yet hath she
She oped her eyes and cried: tis he!
And cried within myself: tis he!
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
Men love no more, as only the
Dressed like a London dandy he
And silently I here must die
The bridge and alley to the lake,
I the same admonition make.
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Een as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
For law I _far niente_ take
And every morning I awake
Pedantic although scholar like,
Of the horizon she is like!
The post hath kept him, it is like.
Then suddenly discharge a joke
How artless was the note which spoke
The ladies laughter to provoke.
But now in her effulgence pale
Thus we began our little tale
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile
Twas built, the venerable pile,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
Shall my declining years beguile;
The Russian language I deem vile
About the rain and flax and cattle.
Preserves and an eternal prattle
I owe the censorship a little.
But will not modify a tittle
In solid, unpretentious style,
And a romance in ancient style
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
Because a member I became.
From Gottingen inspired he came,
Will he pursue?But no one came.
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
Believe me, of my present shame
That vicious set whom I dont blame
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By loves inevitable flame.
Who knows? with loves consuming flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Another passed; twas just the same.
His character attracted me.
Of many an economic scheme;
The olden time shall be my theme.
And then the stanzas of my theme
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
My uncles goodness is extreme,
And, inspiration firing me,
Until the sleepless Brguet chime
Transported to our Russian clime.
And visit many a foreign clime,
For a protracted space of time.
Announcing to him dinner-time.
It now to investigate is time,
You will not all abandon me.
Tiresome unto her hath become
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Though to the Academy I come
When will my hour of freedom come!
His name: the tenderness of home
As in her heart the thought sank home,
But Iwhat is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!
Open the windowsit by me.
Oft staring through the window pane
Of the domains of the side-scene.
But shall depict the touching scene
The village wherein yawned Eugene
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
All this was novel to Eugene.
Between myself and my Eugene,
As a poetic life serene,
And irrigate them with champagne;
A single being: twas in fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,
The lamps illuminating shine;
Tis Heavens will and I am thine.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
With many a snare their pathway line!
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
No other than Onegin mine.
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Of my impassioned heroine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
The sum of my existence gone
That hero, though his merit shone,
Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Having for moneys sake alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Good-night. Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his cominghis alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
She murmurs in an undertone
That all may hear his voices tone.
That like a friendly voice its tone
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
No answer all that day was borne.
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The mystic monogram, O. E.
The aged woman in her woe:
Een hopeless egoisms dark shape.
With taffety instead of crape.
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
In country solitude you mope,
Tis said you are a misanthrope,
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Was he in health and void of care?
Tattianas beauty, pale with care,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Or vainly mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
And impiously should declare,
I cannot help it I declare,
The riot of the world and glare
Here I remark all poets are
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Tattianas love was quite sincere,
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
Abandon hope for ever here!
Hes here! Eugene is here!
(I speak not of our poems here),
And Eugene soon discovered there
I promised!Did I so?Well, there!
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talons, where
I yield the fruit of work severe.
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Their privileged allurements fire
With our Onegin doth aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Whose tones Apollos sons inspire,
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire;
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
So ardently did I desire
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
His constant soul could ever tire,
The wit of others to acquire.
Opened with care, and entering bore
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Or, as it were, the Freischutz score
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
My spirit with such pangs before.
Thoult suffer, dearest, but before,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
The captives of the Salguirs shore.
Or by the oceans rocky shore.
Tis time to quit this weary shore
And thy protection I implore.
With affectation,nothing more.
A gust of passion never tore
Endowing us from out her store
But which, my dear?In days of yore
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
And then she soon twixt work and leisure
And after Albions proud lyre 
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
That a friends arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
To cool the cutlets seething grease,
If seriously he hath disease;
In motley and amusing chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Address to you one single phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Eugene would speak regarding these.
She would pronounce _ la Franaise_;
Of passion they so often raise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bitthey scandalise
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Tired by the balls incessant noise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
Olga the tea must supervise
He is a charming youth and wise.
Manforty years long in this wise
But now a question in this wise
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
A curious interest disclose
Command me, darling, what you choose
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Most usually a Cossack horse
In age the memory gets worse,
Existence would not make a curse,
How dull you are this morning, nurse!
All visited him at first, of course;
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and mans applause,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
But look youah! do not refuse.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
But I must now employ my Muse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use
Then became busy with the house,
Night separated from her spouse,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
They long ago had held debate.
My famous portrait indicate
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
On Lenskis matrimonial fate
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The hostess doth interrogate:
He nears a spacious mansions gate,
Both were expectant of the hate
Your fashionable world I hate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
But if the truth I must relate,
But tell me, nurse, can you relate
He hath neglected us of late.
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But now my mind is desolate,
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
I had found my predestinate,
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
By time (who can anticipate?)
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
You in the least commiserate
If but to lighten Times dull rate,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
By an _obroks_ indulgent rate:
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Perchance some heart twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
By rank as settled by the State.
The sorrows of a single state.
I am not strong enough to state;
Around my stanzas incomplete
With unanimity complete,
The fervid poet would recite,
Was certainly not erudite
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
I have endured without respite.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
A Russian household simple quite,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
Fond declarations they invite
On innocent delights I dote,
On balls I madly used to dote,
With vale finish off a note;
Or the delivery of a note.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
And an elegiac poem wrote.
So let us to the ball-room haste,
We must admit but little taste
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
And she despite herself would waste
And ease and fashionable waste,
And education runs to waste,
This anchorite amid his waste
Device of rural minds acute!)
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My countrys honour and repute
Her all in all did constitute;
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Onegin knew enough, the rogue
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
He racked his brains to find its clue
His vanity first let us pique
Without the faintest trace to leave
And all without her husbands leave.
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
But promise of our meeting gave,
The prejudices all men have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
He sang of loveto love a slave.
The fatal secrets of the grave,
My guardian angel to the grave.
The moderns of the ancients rave
The Lord deliver her and save!
Thus to assassinate the eve?
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
Not at all.That I cant conceive!
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To me he would his Olga give,
Time without me will lessons give,
But I await thee: scarce alive
The most industrious man alive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Would whisper: shall I so long live?
So meantime let him joyous live
And our successors soon shall drive
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
What boots it with the age to strive?
Applause, the peoples donative.
There our Katnine did revive
My heart with but one look revive;
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The all-entrancing joys of love
Extendedhaunt which Dryads love.
By absence who hath chilled his love,
With tears which secret sufferers love
The malady of hopeless love
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Striking the intellect with awe
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
The cynosure of every eye.
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
Extinguished ashes do not blaze
No, never in the early blaze
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Loves pangs Tattiana agonize.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
They made him feel inclined to doze;
This great discovery relief
Habit alleviates the grief
With deeper woe than others grief.
To write of any other elf
Than ones own fascinating self.
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Even beneath her parents roof
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Espy him approaching,
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Onguines letter!Ah! the thing!
I guard it as a holy thing,
Shone pungent Satires dauntless king,
But why are your cheeks whitening?
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
The world is ever altering!
Amidst successes flattering
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,
At last my father gave his blessing,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Attentive to the hearts first beating,
Follow up lovea secret meeting
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
The days which to your youth belong?
But send your grandson before long.
He thought to write, but labour long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
And thus he never fell among
And oft at eventide a throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
Nothing, good nurse, theres nothing wrong,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With dance and with song.
And led me off to church with song.
A double force unto their song
The Maidens Song
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Were you in love when you were young?
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The native Russian tongue impeach?
Alas! with merited reproach.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
With gay design and silken stitch.
I formerly admired her much
Youll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
I call to witness God on high
Sails her allotted course on high,
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
When separations hour drew nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
How dark the night is getting though!
To guess how you the eve pull through.
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Or counting on his uncles death
And what the old man might bequeath.
Without the ken of parents both,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
But memory like a serpents tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
Drive on! the cheerful cry goes forth,
By the fine silver of the north.
For him were but of little worth,
To the impressions of our youth,
But were it not immoral I
My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
In former years thus did not I
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
To listen to the words you speak,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Incessantly his chains to break.
In truth he had the happy trick
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick
The artful prisoner should seek
And thus secures the prey we seek.
At times, if only once a week,
She sank.
Hes a freemason, so we think.
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Alone he doth his claret drink,
How bright and tender was his look,
Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
For promises her feet reveal
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to glorys goal.
And others rise ephemeral!
In one thing really did excel.
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
To suchdelightful to repel.
The Country Damsel
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail
God grant I meet not at a ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
Some future ignoramus shall
Exclaiming, We must change em all!
Nor years of separation all
Indifferent he became to all,
Her sentimental verses all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
Repentance wields not now her spell
The steward sent a note to tell
I am in love, her whispers tell
I amin loveyou knowdont tell!
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Ennui can in the country dwell
And wished to say to him farewell.
How thy hands burn!Dear nurse, I'm well.
To take this letter to O Well!
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
And gallicisms I love as well
My hearts delight, thou art not well.
Boredom, my friend, behold the ill
My unpretending page shall fill,
The pervert world with icy chill
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
To listen to the rippling rill.
Tis habit, Lenski.Is your ill
His heart reciprocated still
Domestic life attracts me still,
How now, Onegin, yawning still?
Or couplets more ingenious still;
To wander through the meadows still,
Time was, the poets tender quill
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Perchance they laurels also cull
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
You know that I am now a fool
He was a dear delightful fool
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Monsieur lAbb a starving Gaul,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now dont be cross with me, my soul,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Enchanted by the moons pale beam.
And a boy handed round the cream.
Guards fondly hopes uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Eugene at first began to dream,
The story of his young loves dream,
I will descant on loves sweet dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Een from her cradles earliest dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Thoult quaff loves sweet envenomed stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Perish absorbed by Lethes stream.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Merciful God, what will he deem?
Torquato Tassos strains I deem.
Tis something of this sort I deem.
Providence otherwise may deem
He hath acquired the worlds esteem
But, as he never opened them,
Is ever ready to proclaim
With such a perversity proclaim.
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Silent, oracular yet see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails fore him,
He sang of separation grim,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
She waited forI dont know whom!
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Twas plainan oaken floor ye scan,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
How came you then to wed a man?
At last became a ruined man.
Let me present ye to the man,
He was an honest gentleman,
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva een
In her friends albums, time had been,
There friends of pure delight had been
A fond and careful mother been.
Obedient she had ever been
And fields my joys have ever been;
Become a faithful wife and een
My joy in youth was fleeting een
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
As your light footprints on the green.
In springtime on the meadows green,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
The torment born of crime unseen,
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before him red roast beef is seen
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
His malady, whose cause I ween
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
His friendship I acquired just then;
The cold reply with gloomy mien
Approach not to hearken
The tale of these romantic men;
Amid submissive herds of men
Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Yawning betook him to a pen.
I know that Parnys tender pen
Onegin was a citizen
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
How bitterly he would malign,
Dreading the worlds remarks malign,
But boldly I myself resign:
My hearts allegiance can resign,
Thine honour is my countersign!
My gratitude do not disdain,
To crush me with a just disdain.
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Should dearly like a dance again.
The youthful lover once again
Of love again, and yet again;
And agitate my heart again;
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Would she in silence long remain.
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is twould cause me pain
And an habitual sense of pain;
My darling child, thou art in pain.
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain
A case of books he doth obtain
My light productions to retain,
His daughters book to ascertain
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
And distance interposed in vain,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
I've wasted in amusements vain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
For Gods sake, Lenski, dont begin!
Tattianas Letter to Onegin
With words of foreign origin
Still everywhere, without, within,
WhereWhat! another eclogue spin?
Pardon I ask for such a sin
In books he saw nought to condemn
And that unrivalled paragon,
And gossip of the town and fashion
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
The youthful poets fond confession.
Shall abdicate the bards profession,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
And tears of reconciliation:
Tattiana was her appellation.
A coquette loves by calculation,
Enhances love in estimation
Long time her young imagination
Original imagination,
She did not think procrastination
Their Jealousy and separation
The fair of the next generation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
And eye which gleams with inspiration
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
The poets fervid conversation
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
Without constraint in conversation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
As formerly much agitation.
And long internal agitation
A love which knew no limitation,
Thy meditative incantation
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime Onguines apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
My very latest composition!
And a determined disposition,
For journalistic deglutition
Rescue me from oblivion.
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tis silenton her shines the moon
And now tis night, the guardian moon
His wife was also mad upon
She was thus fond of Richardson
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Or that adoring Grandison
Was certainly no Grandison.
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Silvers the brook; the shepherds horn
A jolly song and distant horn;
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Which neath her pillow lay till morn.
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Then to some gallant in your turn
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
In silence shall I sit and yawn
The untutored spirits pangs calmed down
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
And on the footstool sitting down
I feel thou wast by God sent down
The aged nurse in ample gown,
But, to his uncles mansion flown,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
And bitter torment never known.
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown, 
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
When will the devil take his own!
Impelled to union with his own
Far from his Italyhis own.
He left _you_ first, and I must own
Which we experienced long ago.
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go
Good-bye, Onegin, I must go.
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
I cannot understand. But lo!
Present me.You are joking.No.
More troublesome than usual?No!
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
Inspired him with disgust and so
Or a professor in tulle cap.
When captured in a schoolboys cap;
Or at a promenade mayhap,
With iridescent wing doth flap
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Like down from Aeoluss lip,
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
The sudden rattling of a car.
All are constrained and fetters bear,
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
I cant conceive a little dear
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Unseen thou wast already dear.
The path of hope and tender fear
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
When youths rebellious hour drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
So irremissible appear?
Would at the proper time appear.
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Go, on the Nevas bank appear,
Doth in us or our names appear
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
And from the Millionaya afar
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
And hat surnamed a Bolivar
As in the timid forest deer,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
At Lrinas.Hem, that is queer!
Well!I the elder should prefer,
Romance of love I pray refer,
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
The younger, youre in love with her!
Doth loves incautiousness in her
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
Recent instructions of its mother.
Gravely repeating to another
But finally grew bored by her.
Servant of God and brigadier,
La Morale est dans la nature des choses.NeckerOn waves by tempests curdled o'er!
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Confront thy fated torturer!
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.
This was his social character.
The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
At Russ she was by no means clever
Hope with her fascinating power
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Pray is it not a tough affair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
The gossip of their ladies fair.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my Onegin free as air,
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Urging your droshkies swift as air
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_
But gray Phillippevna the door
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Upon the ball-rooms glassy floor
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Lest the malicious reader or
Some one or other editor
And wheresoeer thy footsteps err,
Impressionable for an hour,
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
In this case quite mistaken was.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
She the delicious novel reads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
And rising from her bench proceeds;
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
Are ye replaced by other maids
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
His son and mortgages his lands.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient to warm Springs commands.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
Where each young critic ready stands,
At times my reason almost bends,
No one my anguish comprehends,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Existence without wife or friends,
His hate by slander, and who spends
And care but little for its ends.
Appear attuned to softer chords;
At least their accents and their words
My goddesses, where are your shades?
May be that I by heavens decrees
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Look through the window and kill flies.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
When the same life before him lies
What mores required? The world replies,
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Had come both friends and enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
She from the winter corn espies
Some a mazurka occupies,
Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
And pelt him with cherries,
With raspberries, cherries.
At neighbouring hospitalities.
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
Without grammatical mistakes.
May be, and this my terror wakes,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And due precautions take betimes.
Alas! he loved as in our times
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Longer the East inert reclines
Wherein love innocently pines.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The accents wild of others woes,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
And still the coachmen round the fires
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And now his youthful heart desires
And of the irksome harness tires,
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! Onegin passes
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or ftes;
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltics salt sea waves,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
And now she skips and now she springs
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Goddess of lovers tender sighs.
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Eugene, more tolerant than this
And deem the world perfection is!
Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Dianas bosom, Floras cheeks,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
A horses hoofs she hearsShe shrinks!
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails;
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
When the sonorous Brguet tells
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
For rural solitude and dreams,
To agitate me in my dreams.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
And more imagination teems.
The frolics of maidens.
The secrets of maidens.
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
To secrets of virgins,
Friends and companions,
Old peoples simple conversations
Their offsprings innocent flirtations
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
For dolls, een from her earliest years,
Have shone as one of fashions leaders.
Onegin, O my gentle readers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Nor boston nor the worlds affairs
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Also their feetyet neertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
A child devoid of childishness
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
Await the long-delayed caress.
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
But Eugene long hath left the press
A young Armidas lips to press,
To fawn upon and love express;
I like the difference to express
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Tattianas letter I possess,
If the raw product they possess
This gentle daring who could guess?
Have felt loves agitated kiss
A ladys hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
As every journal now entreats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Along Saint Petersburgs paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Will teach grammatical conceits,
With cherries, red currants,
And like Napoleons each of us
A million bipeds reckons thus
Corneilles majestic genius,
A critic of the stage malicious,
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
A slave of actresses capricious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
There Didelot became glorious,
By such allusions scandalous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
The drive becomes monotonous
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Well! Lrina appears to us
Come sing we in chorus
The friend of liberty and laws
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
And through the lofty windows views
To male acquaintances he bows,
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passions fire no longer glows
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
For otherwiseGod only knows!
Upon the dreary northern snows,
On unknown female forms he throws.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows
But even thus not now-a-days!
Of fiery youths untutored days
To vary for a few brief days.
We called to mind our youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
And then to meditate for days
The very morning of our days.
In one of thine enchanting lays
Or Bogdanovitchs sweet lays.
No more with pale Dianas rays,
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
I mean my name not to repeat.
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great;
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
On this artistical retreat
A ball here, there a childrens treat,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Removed her to his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
No misery I see in that
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?
So prudent, and so circumspect
The disenchanted glass direct
Of the neid, but incorrect.
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladies faces and their feet.
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
The words and looks of charmers sweet
To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Of one thing till again we met.
And wean unattractive set
Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Then amongst strangers I was left
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
But from the Muses loftiest height
China and bronze the tables weight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgato a light
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
Abandoning insane delight,
They will receive us with delight.
A sense of social delight,
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
And like the prisoners our delight
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
As a babes slumber, or the light
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight;
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And showed with an uncertain light
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
But lo! already the moons light
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Lay languishing both day and night
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
Delighted.When?This very night.
His ditties were as pure and bright
Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Adorned with many a vision bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
In winter on the fender bright,
I was half silly with affright.
In the first place, say, am I right?
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
If they were similar in aught.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Immersed in melancholy thought,
She hears of conversation nought
And my dark soul to light was brought;
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
At first such contradictions wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
The early days of life we sought.
On guests their servants used to wait
Must take a walk and rest a bit
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
This he believed: a kindred spirit
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Een as the poet says he leant.
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And o'er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Because she was so innocent,
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
Neer touched her fingers indolent
Or torturer malevolent?
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
And pleasures daily blandishment,
A timid love to banishment?
Having this mournful document
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
Now it is ready to be sent
Their heroes used to represent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
To a surrender gave consent,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content;
Time was, in style magniloquent
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
In spite of common sense were wont
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
And consolation soon begot.
What once I knew is clean forgot
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exiles lot;
Alas! how wretched now my lot!
To Russ indigenous are not;
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Was a delightful little spot,
Just before dinner-time he slept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt loves fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Wherein I buried left my heart.
The fires of passion and its smart
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Poetic transport. They impart
Her passions faithful counterpart,
How well he played the greenhorns part
How soon he learnt deceptions art,
Sometimes by pleasing flatterys art,
Eugene designed with me to start
His own antagonists expert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
An infant maiden doth exhort
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Bard of the Feasts, and mournful breast,
Twas she who first within his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Must een despise his kind at last;
The fatal hour had come at last
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
The body they consigned to rest,
Nurse, tis so close I cannot rest.
And then made merry pope and guest,
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Am I to go through the whole list?
So many neighbours here exist
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
All the young people round about,
Can we not stealthily make out
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Their claims and explanations shout.
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
I have known beauties cold and raw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
Because he yawned at the bare view
Russias Terpsichore review
I still a complication view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Mornings forerunners, breezes blow
A feeble version read below,
All the creations which below
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
From happy inspiration flow,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
And herds of oxen wandering low;
I am in love, nurse! leave me now.
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
But such is not my project now,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
And also fashionable beaux.
Chained to his bedside night and day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
And in reality one day
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
And wholly occupied his day
Olgas admirer came that day:
As men who much had done that day.
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
Arrange without the least delay
The bridegroom sage without delay
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
How sick to death his uncle lay
Within his memory there lay,
How often in thine arms I lay;
Then, her distraction to allay,
How with thy medal I would play,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
And though perchance a lady may
Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
Avowal then twas time to pray,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
Nor doth my absent pen portray
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And starting suddenly doth say:
Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
With serious air then went away
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
No trace ye left in passing by
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Nor by her sisters brilliancy
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
More crimson every moment they.
A lovers letter might convey,
Possess my love and sympathy.
At least by show of sympathy;
I cannot tell the reason why,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
And now we hear delightedly
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
Harvests of souls unceasingly
And like Childe Harold gloomily
With him were friends eternally:
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
In the French language perfectly,
Then send your grandson quietly
The same warm vision constantly;
Employ your glasses constantly,
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
He brought from mystic Germany
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Then be it so! My destiny
She loved upon the balcony
It occupied him from a boy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
The happiest days of life employ?
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
To be a charming mystery:
Alike by sighs and flattery.
Relate some ancient history.
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Fragments of northern poetry,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Byrons capricious phantasy
Carried away by ecstasy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lest jaded with satiety,
Upon its damp opacity,
Charming with grave simplicity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
Like him renouncing vanity,
Hears not my importunity!
As Winter in their purity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
With hope and then perplexity,
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
Of tender years the modesty

Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
At last the author! cries Mamma.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The Lrina
Bouynoff whisked off Poustiakova.
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
The inmate is for ever dumb,
He found them in an almanac,
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
All silently hung down his head.
For patience, reader, I must plead!
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
A little farther please to read
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
He long should have been on the road.
He dragged her by a forest road
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
With hopeless passion: from her bed
And finally, upon his bed
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed;
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Not all will like myself proceed
Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Up to the attic, and all need
Had run across her path at speed,
Wheneer across the plain at speed
From the moist cork the bottle freed
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Was with himself dissatisfied.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
The new moons crescent slim she spied,
Tattianas trouble might have spied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied
Longtime her mind is occupied.
I shall expire, Tattiana cried,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
He round the billiard-table stalked,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
Nor marked how summers prime had fled
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
What ails thee?Nothing.He is fled.
The troop of apparitions fled,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Zaretski shouted: Why, hes killed!
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A hermits life Onegin led,
A life of fact, not fiction, led
And to the field of honour led;
Surely ye all have overhauled
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
When hopes delightful flower but bloomed
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained
My sum of happiness contained;
A tender couplet he combined,
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
There, aping Gulnares bard, he spanned
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The maidens weary eye which yearned,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
An explanation: she was scared,
Another with cocks head appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
For evermore had disappeared.
With Olga; nor of this appeared
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Contented and with victuals stored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
And what she from the cards inferred.
Tattiana every day conferred
Of Olga he in song averred;
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Of censure for the same incurred;
The poet from Tamboff secured,
On melted wax in water poured;
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
More timid than a doe long chased,
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
And Flinoff, somewhat indisposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
At home arriving he addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Are not with elegance impressed.
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Not agony, but death expressed.
But once more pensive and distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
By friendship how they were abused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
His visit she had not awaited,
And every year distributed
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved
Onegin, by first impulse moved,
And ancient usages observed
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Eight rubbers were already played,
Change of position had essayed,
What is your name? The boor looked dazed,
And Agathon replied, amazed.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
And long perukes hath vanishd.
And her upon the threshold laid.
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
A load of care upon the maid.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Remained with him the youthful maid.
In Olgas album, youthful maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Onegin then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
In whispers low the neighbours said:
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
In mist profound all yet is hid.
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
Scornfully challenged you afield
And can it be? But late a child
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
These evenings as in days of old
Tattiana in traditions old
In dreams and what the moon foretold
And the young ladies fortunes told,
Heard he the truth? And thus she could
She promised Eugene, or she would
To Olga frequently he would
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A weary season was at hand
And in the bathroom did command
The poet, modest though so grand,
Gazing on Lenskis corse did stand
November at the gate did stand.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
The thunderbolt on you descend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Will you?Agreed.I thank you, friend,
An ear to my confession lend;
Assistance ever will extend,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she entersbear behind,
Your second you have left behind!
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Had perished a creative mind,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Become alarmed. So never mind!
But one thought only filled his mind,
Of all the guests within his mind.
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
A stream, by winters ice unbound,
And if Tattiana mine had found
This monument of thought profound
A tangled wilderness around.
But, when Onguines turn came round,
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
If he had only known the wound
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Whose author nature understood
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And ought he not to disregard
The poets madness? for tis hard
What doth she see? Around the board
The company deep silence guard.
Believed, the peoples wisdom weird,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
She deemed its outline might afford.
Reform me both in deed and word,
Together they returned, nor word
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
I would desire my bride to be
And this fifth canto ought to be
He mused: I will her saviour be!
Or a swift meteor, may be,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Whilst he belle Nina had the face
Pallid and melancholy face,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
By belle Tattiana to replace.
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Drank to her health in the first place,
Warm yourself here a little space!
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Then handed her the song with grace.
The easier tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattianas grace,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
The shining river clothed in ice;
Upon the table in a trice
Two poles together glued by ice,
And his strange conduct at the dance
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
His momentary loving glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
Advance!
Such open-hearted innocence.
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Habit would bring indifference.
To friendship making no pretence,
I cannot tell on what pretence
Our idol, Honours motive force,
And yet oblivion forbade.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
It may be that his martyred shade
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
Was the first question Olga made,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
But no reply unto her made.
Whose heart experience icy made
They shovel silver with a spade,
But cannot anyhow evade
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
His fate shall presently decide.
She leisurely away doth ride,
Unto the windmill he must ride
In consultation stand aside
But now all doubt was set aside,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
A pair of bulletsnought beside
Yes, happythough she at his side
Found them in darkness side by side,
Jaws are at work. On every side
Always together, eventide
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Of a most mournful episode,
Upon my visions such intrude.
In worldly din or solitude
Measured with great exactitude.
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tender and elevated, free?
From such digressions wholly free.
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Tome of Malvina, and but three
The poets hour hath soundedSee!
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
He usually was glad to see
Such was Onguines sainted life,
He in the early years of life
In many things had changed his life
Should be respected throughout life
And leads a solitary life?
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Of error and the passions strife.
The Muse abandoned, taen a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
Wherein the miserable wife
In boston and the game of age,
And testy gamesters do engage
Sterner solicitudes engage,
As once, to fill the rapid page
But sweeter still it is to arrange
Placed at the customary range;
No one the contrary will urge,
Again a century should scourge
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Tania well nigh expired when he
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And a half rubles down gave she;
And disappear in space; then she
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
Therell be a fight. I do not lie.
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Or any trifle else ye like
Onegin waits on us, tis like.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
And barely visible the smoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followeda light broke
Tattiana terrified awoke.
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
I know theres none more amiable.
Fashion is there immutable,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
To see aughtnever mind meanwhile)
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Espying, Eugene with a smile
That afterwards with evil smile
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
But he desired not to beguile
Nasce una gente a cui l morir non duole.
He wrote (tis the romantic style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A novel in Lafontaines style,
To sketch ye in Albanos style.
The door flew openOlga came,
And straight returning whence he came,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Athwart the snow four paces came
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
Wheneer a brilliant courtly dame
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatreds flame
Who reads his visionary theme
Descends the bank with care extreme,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
How in the country pass this time?
And may fall headlong any time.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Across her youth a shade had come,
All dark and silent hath become;
And shorter had the days become.
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Triumphant with the answer come.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
Homeward returning, he at home
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
With better half as cumbersome;
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
Howl like a dolt: tis meant for me!
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Undeviating and insane
Struck Lenski deadacross the scene
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
My second! cried in turn Eugene,
He was in error; for Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Are turned upon her. All combine
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?
Diminishes as years decline.
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Bouynoff, wrathful cousin mine,
In one great shout: shes mine! shes mine!
A tombstone, Aphrodites shrine,
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Give me just half a glass of wine
With loud explosion, the bright wine
All to the grand saloon are gone
To pass the night at home hath gone.
The ball in all its splendour shone.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
In horror for itself alone,
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
And in the frosty night alone
Though around honoured Priams throne
Mine! cried Eugene with savage tone.
Said something in an undertone
But that the eyes of every one
A constant harping on one tune,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
Or quietly partake our woe.
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Albums magnificent which scare
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Lenski at intervals would dare,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
But, O ye tomes without compare,
With all their progeny were there,
And lo! he is already there!
And be not in advance severe.
Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
And spouted it with lyric fire
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Like D when dinner doth inspire.
To mutter her concealed desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
The Russian winter did adore
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
To help her to the other shore
As if against obstruction sore
Away her golden earrings tore;
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Bouynoff too, my cousin, wore
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
He will delight you, I am sure,
Serious endeavours to assure
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Of modern Russians the disease.
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
I say without poetic phrase,
Who every gesture, every phrase
It matters not. Hope een to these
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Miraculously fair arise,
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
The Lrinas were since sunrise
Olga began to long likewise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
May be the empire of the sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Though now my love might be intense,
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Furious he from the table rose;
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
At womankind he growled a curse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
But I the products of my Muse,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Now, as in a deserted house,
What can be drearier than the house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
They would not solemnly debate
But this amusement delicate
Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
She muses: What was Olgas fate?
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
(Like other things I could relate)
Sometime collected, shall relate
That year the autumn season late
Longtime was her heart desolate
But I came not to adulate:
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
Perchance one more affectionate.
The Lrinas would celebrate,
But merely to exasperate;
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
If cleverly or not I prate.
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
The secrets of the marriage state
Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate
In bud of promise incomplete,
Encountered punishment complete,
Me?Yes! It is Tattianas fte
When poets lachrymose recite
A bottle of a vintage white
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
Trembles upon my lips from spite,
A philosophic anchorite:
Who thrives this moment as I write,
But I must add to what I write
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
By Olga stood, dejected quite
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Lenski his comrade did invite.
I on my chosen hero dote;
Your innocent and charming note
To purest love he tuned his note
When in simplicity ye wrote
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
And the attendants called in haste.
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Subscribed, _toujours vous, Annette;_
Ah! it may be, affection true
Into delicious bondage gave
Was it not so?for thee I gave,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
For him an honourable grave,
And thy inebriating wave
To mention the foregoing eve,
To standards in which we believe?
These are your relatives, believe:
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
To jest as he had done last eve,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
What I by relatives conceive?
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Mutual destruction to contrive.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And loves you asa relative!
That guests approach: and when above
And enmity and hope and love
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
I love you with a brothers love,
Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
Around the meadow and the grove.
If Olga smilingly approve,
Time was when cold seduction strove
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Him who inspired both love and awe,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
And supper. In the country we
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
But, cried Zaretski in amaze,
A hand of ice appeared to seize
The hero we immortalize.
Having lost all in life we prize.
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And honestly tis my belief
Is ever ready with relief,
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
Our union would produce but grief.
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, Bouynoff, Ptushkoff
The family of Kharlikoff,
Then dressed himself... 
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The language of her girlish pleading
Page after page continued reading,
However, Tanias letter reading,
But she, her sister never heeding,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Or, parable more flattering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
In life domestic see a string
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Behold! orthography despising,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Metreless verses recognizing
Either with him or thee in song,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Make up your mind to go there.Ah!
His entrance with Onegin. Ah!
Thus did our friend Onegin preach:
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Attentive listened to his speech,
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Petrarch
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
But home his body to despatch
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
With great delight.O God on high!
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
List! the snow cruncheshe draws nigh!
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
In scenes like these it may be though,
His breast was riddled through and through,
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their complimentsbut oh!
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
_Affectionately yours till death_.
When motionless your gaze beneath
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
You o'er your wine insulted hath
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Or even overcome by wrath
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
The last poor obol I was worth
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
My word of honour given have I.
O my Svetlana.Joukvski
Not in the least, assured am I!
La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
Openly or neath decent cloak.
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
Bruin is marching at her back!
And the sagacious Triquet back
Himself transformed into a hack;
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
They have invited you this week.
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook
His fist Onegin fiercely shook
But somehow there shone in his look
To flight before her radiant look,
His course unto the running brook.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And clad in airy costume took
Jealousy and vexation took
Till absently Vladimir took
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
And female tears hysterical,
When the mazurka used to peal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What will the coming dawn reveal?
Nought of its charms original
A ball in Peters capital,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
Though of romance therein I fail
In time I'll give ye without fail
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
A true account and in detail.
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Crush and confusion in the hall,
For long he had endured them all.
Bedding is laid out and to all
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his browstis silent all.
Shouts, laughter, jamming gainst the wall,
For consecrate to me he fell
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
A worthy object tis, and well
And think: here lies who loved me well,
The family are all quite well
Are all your relatives quite well?
And sometimes into snares as well
Ptushkoff, the provincial swell;
Onegin acted very well
And wisely gallops to the hill.
You fall in love again. But still
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
(See the first canto if ye will),
Tis evidently Heavens will
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a gooses neck a skull
In order due the maidens pull;
At eighteen not to play the fool!
Conventionalitys dull tool
Learn to possess more self-control.
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
The memory of the bard, a dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Will be absorbed by Lethes stream;
And a malicious epigram
And loves delicious diadem
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
And true, his pistols faultless aim
In winter by its blank and dim
Its driver seated on the rim
From first to last page to the rim.
A country damsels album trim,
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
The forests in mysterious gloom
All slumber. In the drawing-room
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monsters arm,
Dressing as quickly as he can,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
Onegin slowly then began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Vladimirs property, a man
Eugene directs the trusty man
Four deadly paces do they span;
But when Tattianas hand had taen
And satisfied with vengeance taen.
A friendly hand thy life hath taen!
But scarce had maids their saucers taen
Assuredly should not have been
Had a deluded victim been
Which never have existed, een
Come, she cried, sister, tell me een
To this arrangement can be seen,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures een,
Whom you in slumber may have seen.
In little maidens of thirteen?
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
The imagination to enliven
By sympathy I have been driven.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Listen to me without disdain.
But to the garden once again
Onegin, bored to death again,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
That until Christmas comes again
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
By an avowal just as plain.
He there is masterthat is plain;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?
Spare yourself unavailing pain
I know not if his heart felt pain
The bards enthusiastic strain,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Tania the meaning would obtain
Although her book did not contain
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
To raise a clamour and a din:
In solitude or worldly din,
Ere conversation could begin,
But by degrees the crowd begin
The pall of night was growing thin,
At morn an icy bath within
He heard his souls complaint within,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
A canine face with horns thereon,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
Behold! the worlds opinion!
The natural fickleness of passion,
Onegin went with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Triumphant by anticipation,
Not knowing its interpretation,
Alone within his habitation
And buried deep in meditation,
And marking Tanias agitation,
Lenski the foemans apparition
Was worthy of that old baboon,
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Why did you leave last night so soon?
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
Herself not knowing well the reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
Sailed silently in unison
There an imperious skeleton;
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He seemed for matrimony born.
Bright day will then begin to burn,
My wretched Lenskis fate I mourn,
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Delighted glances in return;
Have entered never to return.
Men will forget me, but my urn
But lo! forth from the valleys dun
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,
Across the smiling face of dawn.
As when the tempests veil is drawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And at the table sat her down.
And the fair sex as light as down!
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Approach, approach; I am thine own.
In a half-open dressing-gown
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
The opportunity is flown.
For summer to the country flown,
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For o'er a word to fashion known,
What everybody long has known;
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Ideal, he had drowsy grown.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
This northern summer of our own,
And the young damsel from the town,
Troys sages should in concert own
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
They hand in hand to table go.
Whither that evening he will go.
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
Shall we commence?Let it be so,
I'm happy, say, is it not so?
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Hes a straightforward little chap.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
And all in snow is buried deep.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Buried in meditation deep,
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
The maids beside Tattiana keep
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Or een Istomina, my dear,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
There is a spot the village near
With sad refrain misfortune near.
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
Do me a favour and appear.
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
But as to fightingtwill appear!
The shining orbs of night appear;
More advantageously appear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
He bending whispered in her ear
And breathe a drama in his ear.
The simple epitapha tear
Oer my remains to drop a tear,
For us, may be for many a year.
And grown more curious by far
Unhappily too salt by far;
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Gliding in negligent career,
Amid the company career.
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
He leisurely adorns for her.
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Where dwelt the Muses worshipper,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
I'm beaten in another matter;
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
The less we love a lady fair
But with confused and bashful air,
Finally tost his arms in air
And the Skatnines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
And Flinoff, pensioned councillor,
She cannotEugene oped the door
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Onegin firedAlas! alas!
With purple hand Aurora leads,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
With tranquil air Onegin leads
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And a grand festival proceeds.
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
To bring behind: the triple steeds
Tattiana to a corner, bids
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
I've had to make for having friends!
Against my inclination, friends,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
O feet, whereer your path extends
With love which happiness extends;
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Tattiana motionless abides.
The unbidden guests he roughly chides
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
And all thy precious elegies,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Tattiana to the index flies
Oerwhelmed with guests; by families
Ever to hear the same replies
All breathless and without replies.
His friends and also enemies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
He roars, and Ah! Tattiana cries.
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
Than cold Onguines oddities,
And fashions gay frivolities;
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
I sail upon my lake at times
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Whom pale Dianas ray illumes
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
The golden ember now enshrines,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
All arise. To the door he goes.
All vanished as an echo goes.
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Imaginations sacred fires,
And where tempestuous loves desires,
In true interpretation hates:
And slowly life coagulates
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
_Quecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
To the pianoforte he moves
And various chords upon it proves,
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
The time between the wolf and dogs
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
I just hint, in parenthesis,
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
And where the admirable streams
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
In Olgas and Tattianas rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Barking, young ladies osculations,
Latest arrivals salutations,
Had finished life amid his sons,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
But to Onegin! _A propos!_
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
The two friends compliments she hears
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
With his ferocious mate appears.
And what from its recess appears?
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But foolstheir calumnies and sneers
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Tattiana certainly infers
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Yet satiated with success,
And now, I mournfully confess,
If the domestic hearth could bless
Me your perfections would not bless;
With fir-trees standing motionless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
In melancholy loveliness,
He _cannot_ give me happiness.
But strange am I to happiness;
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
In rhyming I show laziness.
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness;
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
She hears the bear behind her press,
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Her agitation and distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymens embarrassments, distress,
A strong resemblance these possess
If wife and children to possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
The uncontaminated kiss
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
But, after mutual compliments,
The epistle from the bard presents.
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
The Paris of those country parts
Though for his Helen Menelaus
The stomach doth admonish us.
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Oh! who is not calumnious?
By Tolstoys pencil marvellous,
It was a cheery, generous
Who labours hard to humour us?
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
His watch, the sun in turn he views
And this the faithful one allows,
And all the joys which Winter knows.
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
And I confess that now-a-days
As partner of my mournful days,
Companion of my childhoods days.
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Onegin his excuses says;
Till the mazurkas close he stays,
A joyous troop of little boys
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
With lovers rubbish filled, was neat
A hundred times will not repeat,
Begins to talk of this and that,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, tis but to pay a debt,
And blush to own himself reflect.
With so much warmth and intellect?
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
The glass unwittingly inspect
Such am I. This did ye expect,
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
The miserable bard to meet,
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Of every sort and every set!
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
And hurried home his awful freight.
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
I with my friend intend to fight!
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
Een for an instant find delight,
But death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
_Who in thy love finds more delight
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
In such an album with delight
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight.
My pen no longer finds delight,
When tea was brought. Tis my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
And Schiller read by candlelight.
Auroras ruddy rays of light
Having remarked Vladimirs flight,
And swifter than the swallows flight.
Was withered ere the morning light
His care unto his pistols plight,
That the two friends with mornings light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyas I might.
Resounding through all ages might
And blest the shadows of the night.
Outside descend the mists of night.
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
Oerspread with Winters carpet bright,
To youthful Olgas beauty bright,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
A register of fleeting thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
In Tanias praise in pouch he brought,
A table to the fire is brought,
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
My memory wandered wide and sought
From storms protection having sought,
The in memoriam pages sought,
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
For maidens hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
Onegin could not now submit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
His butting horns in anger bent,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
You have a letter to me sent.
But enough! Now, tis my intent
And scanned in silence its content.
Tis time she to the altar went!
And all the three to breakfast went;
Onegin to the window went
The poor girl fell into a faint,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
A forest now she sees in front
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Onegin lightning glances shot;
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Spite of herself with Lenskis lot
Just at this moment I cannot.
Keep your accounts! Youd rather not?
And meditative from the spot
Just manages a feeble trot
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Method was dear unto his heart
The fashionable rhymesters heart!
Within her; she is sick at heart;
But followed the strict rules of art,
Then touching Olga they depart
A hidden meaning could impart,
May well in innocence impart.
Which from the devils bookcase start,
Anew the flames of passion start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
To accompany him and to escort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
But, howsoeer his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
That youthful heartBut, now at least,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Which rankled in Tattianas breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Dons effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Or, after dinners dull repast,
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
To treat the matter as a jest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
Ye feel but little interest,
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
And soGod bless them, if He list.
Their own productions, some insist
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
Satan will jest, and at loves cost.
That every morn at Verreys cost
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Oer all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, twas unjust
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
At forty suffered from the gout,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
My chum lives here, Bruin grunts out.
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
To the young girl he said adieu,
He offers her his murderous paw;
When in that company she saw
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
They are all natural and low,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
To the youth Eugene hurried now
No obstacle of which I know.
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Till January fell no snow
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How charming Olgas shoulders grow!
And all your love on self bestow;
And linen on him doth bestow.
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
And past the threshold of decay,
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Unto their solitude one day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
We visit about Christmas Day,
She gazed around herit was day.
Had much to do at home that day,
That he was ready any day.
She was as heedless and as gay
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Bring dinner now without delay!
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Cunning already to display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Who, heard the music of my lay,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
Or by a card our homage pay,
To see his Olga ere the fray
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
To-morrows dawn will glimmer gray,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Behind, of glasses an array,
The trees in silvery array,
And well-instructed to betray!
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
He cared no longer there to stay,
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Carried a truth divine away;
Onegin Olga bore away.
As it were, tore himself away.
From the dread pistol turn away.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
The lilys stem to eat away,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way;
Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Impetuously clove its way
Onegin sat the table by
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
And (elbows on the table) they
To idle musing was a prey;
He ne'er shall hear Times eulogy,
The witching light of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Presents her quarto amiably,
Upon his couch insensibly;
But not at present, though sincerely
Took aimbut as immediately
Or innocently past me fly.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Who will be there?The family.
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
But of this love, een casually,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Though I'll return to him right early,
From habit or maliciously,
Youll spend your winter famously!
Known unto children perfectly:
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Then hed malign them secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
She cannotthen impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
Around her neck, now violently
The captain of a company.
The man and liked his company,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
She strains her throat to force a cry
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
But scarce had sleeps soft witchery
And turned aside the drapery;
The clue unto some mystery
With ardent sighs and flattery
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow try
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy;
Is full of frigid jealousy,
But man of sense and probity.
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
And husbands tedious amity?
But grant with magnanimity
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Have echoed to eternity.
As giddy youths hilarity
Charming is your sincerity,

Onguines Letter to Tattiana
Each other as the shore we climb!
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
And it may be a secret dread
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
But presently she tried to read;
And two old pines their branches spread
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Grant that I err not on the road.
An idle anchorite and sad,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
Still certain authors, I may add,
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
She could not sleep in her new bed.
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
In what he merely acquiesced.
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceed
Thither in future to proceed
Will not five centuries exceed
Remarkable. She then indeed
Enough, arise! for much we need
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Nay, nearbut destiny decreed
By visions who was ne'er deranged
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A breathless silence then, prolonged
What visions then her fancy thronged
And in society might shed
A visionary mortified,
The princess from the sofa cried
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
And a long time about her talked.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
He conversation would have led
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Of London life is vulgar called
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
As if with eider-down is filled.
And heard a voice cry_Why! Hes killed!_
The channel of the river stilled
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
Her money counted, and designed
Made revelations undesigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
At fifty who relief obtained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
His chambers close wherein confined
At first for books was disinclined,
The venerable dame opined
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
He on the conflagration frowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyshe appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
And Tanias husband soon appeared.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.
My image hath not disappeared,
He went notsooner was prepared
I mused: perhaps the matters squared
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Either she saw not or ignored;
Thus widely meditation erred,
As Saadi anciently averred
In the recesses what hath stirred
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
And leaning gainst the portal closed
To her an elegy composed.
At times three words to him addressed
When all around the entrance pressed,
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Onegin was the most impressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
The maid whose note he still possessed
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Bouynoff courted. She refused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Some Russian authors he perused
A book at early morn perused.
The room my former master used.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
They long at home have her expected
A bastard fame prohibited?
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived;
In vain was youth by us received,
Upon those margins she perceived
At an old aunts they had arrived
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Onegin ne'er as poet showed
Enraptured was he if allowed
Passions wild sway I then allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
That we her constantly betrayed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
And is all light within destroyed?
She on the apparition gazed,
And vehemently though amazed
Should go, the market for a maid,
At early morn returns the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
To classicism I've homage paid,
Adieu she to the matron said
With many a vacancy, tis said.
But finally she softly said:
And spectacles, his knitting staid
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
Had rendered him an invalid;
Returning, from his ship amid
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
As one who bivouacs afield,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
What can be done? She is no child!
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Some marriageable maids behold,
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
The Great World
The Nevas Cleopatra, and
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
The ruts of his own fatherland.
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Sickness more courage doth command
Of a strange night when the moon and
With blessings on the ditches and
None the conviction could withstand
Her tears flow plentifully and
A passionate desire to bend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And thou, persistent to the end,
In duel having killed his friend
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
If not, the money I will lend.
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
And they the waters recommend.
Yet I in idleness expend
My days of life approach their end,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
Enough to see one winters end;
Farther Tattianas walks extend
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
Where thine equal shall we find?
Of which the rustling woods remind?
His immorality of mind
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Onguines pencillings. His mind
That I to you reveal my mind?
These to the coach of state are bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
Lo! in my garden was she found
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
But suddenly all changed around!
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The snows from off the hills around
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Soon Olgas accents shrill resound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
As to a worthy man and good!
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
And spur my spirits torpid mood!
But such is not for me. I brood
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
At this time almost understood.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
How I have erred and felt the rod!
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Your conversation cold and hard,
She enters a deserted yard
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Epistle second, note the third,
Onegin wasted; on my word,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
Of my light paramour was proud.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
That girlbut he must dreaming be
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
No, ever to behold your face,
Where the first time I saw your face,
But gazes on Onguines face
No more the village knows his face,
Depicted on your haughty face!
Onguinethe beloved place
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
The damsel under escort place.
To follow you in every place,
At the front gates, but in brief space
What acrimonious scorn I trace
For there he left a mournful trace.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
In mother Winters strange caprice.
And the extent of his caprice;
Before him her wild game of chance.
Meeting you in times past by chance,
In serious mood or dalliance
God grant that all who herein glance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
And in her hand a French romance.
Seek the forgotten countenance
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And views amongst themselves advance
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Tattiana learns the intelligence
Her amorous experience
And aimless journeys did commence
Oh! what had been his eminence!
His energy and impotence.
Not to behave as he did once
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
In the Lyceums noiseless shade
Though late, have a beginning made.
But sad is the reflection made,
A certain little escapade
And what will Destiny concede?
For ever faithful will abide.
But I am now anothers bride
Like Leonora did she ride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Mute glances interchanged aside
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
And glittering simpletons beside;
Tattiana by a poor aunts side,
Meet punishment for him provide.
And the saloon threw open wide;
Noblesse and models of the mode,
And unto whom we all allude
Deep in the distant province rude,
Secure in rural quietude
Before whom once in solitude,
Daily of love in solitude.
Fly frequent to my solitude,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Displayed a noble rectitude
My scholar without aptitude
To part in amity with thee!
Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
The house and garden I would see.
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingsee!
Know that thy face that day I see.
Olinka is her junior, see.
A mansionby the window, see!
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
To move in fashionable life,
Commence a new career in life
He knew not how to spend his life.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
And rest from bygone days of strife.
So be it! But internal strife
That I am rich, a princes wife?
Without profession, business, wife,
You choose.But who is she?My wife.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But at a later, sterile age,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Another could her heart engage,
A visionary personage
Saint Priest, who every albums page
Or faults of grammar on its page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Another could her woe assuage
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattianas arm a nudge
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
That girl whom once on a time he
Oh! I remember, where is he?
She sits alonetis ever _she!_
On such a day. O Heavens, tis she!
And an encouragement did breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
On Sundays by yon window he,
Before you agonized to die
The family of children hie.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Unknown to all, without a tie,
The fever of the blood to slake
Her promptings unto law did make,
My sportive Muse I used to take
To burn, yet reason keep awake
By computation) it is like
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
A bogy conjured up in joke,
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Onguines cheek grew ashy pale,
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Honour and pride inflexible.
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Her toilettes antiquated style,
And is it long since back he came?
But turn we once more to our dame.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
The old Derjavine noticed me,
And fled afarshe followed me.
And my romances open theme
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Callous to all on earth become
Straight from their province had he come?
In winter time would often come.
At eventide would hither come,
He wakesthey with a letter come
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
No longer through her former home;
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Mournful is thine approach to me,
In the lone garden and the lane?
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
And is it, meditates Eugene.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
She rosedeparted. But Eugene
Departed Lenski here to dine
Behold the dames who once were fine
And make a dark existence shine
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Well known unto Onegin mine.
In your young days and also mine),
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Never upon my heroine
Is it for long?Ma chre cousine!
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helne,
Can she have been a moment gone
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
When, sitting by his fire alone
Twas these he read and these alone
Upon her brow sits wrath alone
The rivers bank. Tattiana lone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
That mediocrity alone
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Tis dreadfulye agree, I hope
Had bid her sigh for without hope
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
O Men, how very like ye are
You with stern countenance declare
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The crash of music, candles glare
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Moscows young Graces at her stare,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Which in the elevated sphere
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Tattiana gently led them there.
And yet the citys flower was there,
The left? Why, what on earth is there?
Faces which we meet everywhere
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Raged round him and of balked desire!
All that a poet could desire,
Adieu! whateer thou didst desire
And our swift troikas never tire;
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
He read as vainly as before,
How oft to the Crimean shore
Of the imperial Nevas shore.
Society renounced once more.
With it may be a couple more;
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Then my companions young with pleasure
For longfor ever. To be sure
Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
In the unfettered hours of leisure
That my dishonour would ensure
Happy who timely grew mature,
For my wild garden and bookcase,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
Can I inspect the mansion, please?
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
A very troublesome disease,
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Tanias heart is not at ease,
The curs away to kennel chase,
Not even a poetic phrase,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
From careless stanzas such as these,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
To God eternal hymns of praise.
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Could in a humble sphere despise,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Is he the same or grown more wise?
With his exasperated sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
Ladies in crowds around her close,
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Now for the first time I my Muse
Received him freely at her house,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
But what results? His eyes peruse
I marriednow, I supplicate
Indifferent was her future fate.
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
With her they did associate,
The time for mystic strolls which late
But round the hostess scintillate
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
And stupid censors passionate;
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate
Tis fearful to anticipate
For evermore is separate.
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
Or Idol mio, and in the grate
His double sashes and his grate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Eternally to imitate
These take their seats; the coach of state
The weary way still incomplete,
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Who the romance do not complete,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Winter resigned her empire white,
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Highways all Russia will unite
Nor even tears afford respite,
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
And irritates the appetite.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
Affection how did you requite?
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
The vestibule finds empty quite
Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
Interrogation to denote.
A dagger, asterisk, or note
In spring-time, heard the cygnets note
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Princesse, mon ange!Pachette!
With this unpleasant _tte--tte_,
And the cast-iron statuette
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
In the beginning, cold and mute,
None could a trace of that impute,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
Alas! my friend, no revenue!
Thou also, my ideal true,
Tis time to marry her, tis true,
No noveltyis it not true?
Then, in the country, ist not true?
I did not please you. Why pursue
For ever your Tattiana leave.
But now our hero we must leave
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A prudent man like you and brave
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But where Melpomene doth rave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
But my Onegin the whole eve
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Just at a moment which I grieve
He called upon me Christmas Eve
I love youto what end deceive?
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
And that too often we receive
His son is married, just conceive!
Of comme il faut. Shishkff, forgive!
I cant translate the adjective.
Along the hall, and high above
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Maidens before her meekly move
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
To strike imagination serve.
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
When the hour came to bid good-bye
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
To arm the tongue and een the eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
Onegin whither gallops? Ye
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On everything around her gaze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And long her eyes as through a haze
Let not the poets spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Who now could fail to recognize
The calm existence which I prize
Dmitrieff
But stop! I will present thee, if
Oh! how our years are vanishing!
Basins and jugswell! everything
Also one Vizemski, remarking
And an old gent the poet marking
To our Tattiana conquering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
To happiness contributing.
Wafted upon poetic wing,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
Glittered in a perspective long,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
She gazeda cue, forgotten long,
And grant success to labour long;
The lively trash of stories long
The nightingale there all night long,
_The date, his fleeting years how long
Terpsichore alone among
And wild festivities among
He quits the fashionable throng
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.
She brought with her the gift of song.
Springs paramour, pours forth her song
Let me explain that in my song
Enough! my pack is now unslung
Since I beheld Eugene and young
I celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
Or letters of a maiden young.
Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
He who life's frosts which early wrung
How meekly then I heard you preach
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
But ultimately doth approach.
Her antiquated mode of speech,
No coquetry was there, I vouch
Society endures not such!
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
Heaved an involuntary sigh
There is no wreath upon the bough:
And the eternal lorgnette through
Above the humble urn of death.
Who early died a gallant death_,
_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
He salutary rules poured forth?
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Restrained the impulses of youth;
My frivolous and jolly youth.
But, knowing not the actual truth,
In that morass where you and I
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
But who abandon it as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
A Russian in Childe Harolds cloak,
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
And he had made her heart beat quick!
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
He enters the saloon. Tis blank!
A door he opens. But why shrank
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Calling to mind your icy look
And shut him in a lonely nook.
The little solitary nook
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
How thoroughly her part she took!
To ask her name the trouble took.
An honourable course ye took,
Caught him and by the collar took
Assemblies oligarchical
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Already he grew phthisical.
Economy political,
What sad emotions o'er me steal
Outlandish and provincial,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Yet suffering emotional
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
When first upon my cheek I feel
With eye precise and without fail.
Winters approach she doth not hail
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Herds low, and under nights dark veil
Another tribune of the ball
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
The rigour of cold pride and all
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
The snow descends and buries all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Lord Byrons portrait on the wall
Hung like a print against the wall,
Long in this fashionable cell
The ladys glance upon him fell
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Of languor and of love did tell
At thirty who was married well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
His relative and friend as well.
This separated us as well
At twenty who was prig or swell,
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Tis now the hillock now the rill
A garden by a shining rill.
An hour passed byanothertill,
The coach before a house stood still.
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
To stay the maid against her will.
He used to hateand was no fool
Of your perfections in my soul,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Tattianas eyes with tender gleam
But Tania just as in a dream
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
A wish from place to place to roam,
Back to his regiment must roam.
Twould serve ye in an epigram
Of priceless value all things seem
With mute appeal to ask they seem
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alleys twilight dim
But could not. Then she questioned him:
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
In some a willing martyrdom.
Is she in love? quoth one. With whom?
Ptushkoff met the selfsame doom.
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
This is my masters sitting-room.
Had he been long here, and where from?
A Russian poems mechanism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
He Benedetta used to hum,
He had excepted from the ban:
Romances three, in which ye scan
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
And my Tattiana now began
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Portrayed contemporary man
I feel, allotted is my span;
Away, Tattiana, hath been taen.
The butt of scandal having been,
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Repose from labour, satire keen,
What a storm of emotions keen
It blew: it howled: till winter een
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,
But nothing changed in them is seen,
Writ in my honour now and then
Onegin, I was younger then,
To pass with reasonable men
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
The poet fell; already men
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
The memory of the bard was driven
With roses, caps and looks malign;
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Shall I behold thee once again?
Onguinetake him up again
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
Me now, inflict upon me pain?
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
After the wedded couple strain;
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Or een the Demon of my strain.
I loved youwhat did I obtain?
The household property contain:
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
And far removed from rumour vain;
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Here, he resides with Simeon.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Although it will not bear translation,
Not high in general estimation;
Invigorate imagination
Of foreign whims the impersonation
And thou, youths early inspiration,
Which is he? or an imitation,
By what idea or observation
The same unmoved oblivion
Beneath the silver of the moon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Without disgust we look upon?
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
His spirit was intent upon.
Still for ever fare thee well.Byron
The counsel good and full of reason,
To visit Moscow in the season.
Cousin, remembrest Grandison?
To write his forefathers to warn
Tattianathus the sex is born.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Or, heedless of the leaves return
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
He is not there: I am not known:
She bows her head beneath the crown;
Have one by one all withered grown
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown
But tell me what am I to do?
Familiar to him long ago.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Is he known to you?Yes and No.
And is it she? It must beno
Yet let us part in friendship, O
But would not look at Cicero.
To?Lrina.Tattiana?So.
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
And so my noon hath come! If so,
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
Together moments one or two
The lady in the crimson cap
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
Mountains well level and through deep
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keep
Since in these arms I thee did bear
To the assembly her they bear.
From everything the heart held dear
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear
She will not see, she will not hear.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
To be in conversation clear
And dost thou know her?We live near.
A lady draws the hostess near,
He daily in his drives drew near
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Never for me to reappear
Unknown to all he doth appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
Two dressed in uniform appear
How Tania grows! Doth it appear
And happy unto you appear.
A vision desolate and drear
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Long ago?Tis the second year.
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
And exclamations and good cheer.
To lawless love I should prefer
And like a shadow haunted her.
Unfavourable unto her.
To Eve the universal mother,
Aye bids ye in some way or other
Together we have wandered o'er
What is his latest character?
Moscow, Russias darling daughter,
Where better?
Fare thee well, and if for ever,
Appear; along the road of Tver
I tremble lest my humble prayer
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
To clank the spur, delight the fair
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
And vanish like a bird in air.
Around the carriage of the pair
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Anicia soon appears, the door
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Is petted by the Emperor?
Opens unto her visitor.
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
And sermonbut in that dread hour
I blame not your behaviour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Plagie Nikolavna has
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Still of his club he member was
His wife approaches, with him leads
That crass stupidity misleads,
And all that from thy hand proceeds
Then come with me. The prince proceeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
Twas eve. Twas dusk. The river speeds
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
With bated breath, around she bends
Tattiana from the hill descends
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Triumphstheir own or those of friends
Their harmless conversation blends
On us beyond the grave attends,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
And wild among them grew her words
Of passion reminiscences,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
The remnant destiny concedes,
Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
And supercilious dames she glides,
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Sits down and gazes on all sides
Of migratory gipsy hordes
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Whom autocratic fates decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
Not the least trace Onegin sees
Where all upon the surface lies,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna utters lies,
The general who accompanies.
To bear loves parching agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the worlds mortal revelries,
To watch with lovers ecstasies,
My splendid house and gaieties
From public and from private ties,
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of life's vanities,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
His recent glory he invokes.
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
To banish far unworthy themes
And the young revellers of past times
The fishers fire afar illumes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And fashionable magazines,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And meditative homeward goes,
Into the tangled garden goes
He fixedly upon her stares
The husband comes and interferes
As with innumerable fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Jackdaws on every spirein scores.
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
A victim decked with golden leaves;
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Where every day before his eyes
His travels like all other things
But still remembrance to him clings,
Along the Nevas bank he sleighs,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Calmly her eyes encounter his
If ye but knew how dreadful tis
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
The princes eye Onegin seeks:
But nowmy very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Springs dissolving beams,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
And the hearts agitated dreams.
And where Thalia softly dreams
Descended swift in turbid streams
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aims
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Insensible her hand remains
His kneeling posture he retains
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
And lonely through the forest creeps.
I will not wed, and ever weeps
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Without participation hears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Mournful Loves deadly trace appears
All in the good old style appears,
Distracted by her grief appears
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
(So twas with us in former years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passions showers,
Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshins school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Balconies, lions heads on doors,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Both day and night he now must pass
Divinity without access
There was no angling for success.
In the worlds vortex my success,
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess
But the indifferent princess,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Speech was so tame and colourless
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
And contemplative dreaminess;
Twas possible then, happiness
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
Their slander een was weariness;
In old age life is weariness!
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Onegin, all this sumptuousness,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express
Inflict annoyance and distress
Loves tender transports and distress,
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Beneath his lips devouring kiss.
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
Its splendour and its blandishments,
She visited the humble tents
The hours once more Onegin counts,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
Ever receive with kindly hearts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Baratynski (_Feasts_)
Deliberate approach of guests
Variety of speech and vests,
She seemed of him oblivious,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
Abandon cities riotous,
Perverse, unfavourable views?
The men salute with lower bows
Mends with the Russian hammers blows
Before a fire which feebly glows
Through dense aristocratic rows
The connoisseur his glances throws
Oer hillock and o'er meadow throws.
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
That vanished are my youthful days
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Or parody of modern ways?
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And hates the worlds discordant ways.
Unto Anicia for the keys
The household troop of little boys,
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheat
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And in a whisper did repeat:
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the studys calm retreat,
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Her brow she did not een contract
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
And watch her eyes full glance to meet.
Her with a smile old women greet,
Near Kharitons in a side street
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Look quickly to your left, my sweet!
Wherein I castigation get;
But time flies and she doth forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
Then in the silent cabinet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
On whom a sisters heart was set
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Onegin, hast forgotten yet
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Of consolation all bereft
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To find in gossip such delight,
And with emotional delight
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
There came a sudden flash of light,
By liberties or loose or light.
Arising with the mornings light,
Could not eclipse her neighbours light.
Yet clearer shines than every light
The ladies dresses airy, light,
Terror of guardians of the night;
Full many a lovely star hath night
And glasses unemployed all night;
And better, if I judge aright;
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
When I yon semicircle bright
And form a network left and right;
And never was the ear affright
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
Tis noisome to her there: in thought
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Again her rural life she sought,
Though by an error and unsought
But now ridiculous a bit.
The table with its lamp unlit,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The master always used to sit.
Griboydoff (_Woe from Wit_)
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The beldam saith: The hearth, by it
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Shines in the female firmament
With scandals trivial ornament.
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
But nownone heeds the monument
Wherein a space Onegin spent.
A while ago the winter spent,
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Time-honoured Kremlins keys present.
Being from hell or heaven sent,
No answer! He another sent.
So Tania to her hearts content
In course of time (the whole extent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Not so! My Moscow never went
The Lrinas unwisely went,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
Long since I held thee at the font
And I to give thee cakes was wont?
Then, the far capital forgot,
Philanthropist or patriot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
One moments slumber suffer not.
Where man is not.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Thee but a little space bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
But the young unpolluted heart
A maidens secretsof the heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
And oft in whispers would impart
Their voices nought to her impart
By flattery and lovers art
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Vociferously paid her court,
Ah! I'm so weakmy throbbing breast!
Deep in our mother Earths chill breast!
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
I weep. And if within your breast
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
She found herself alone at last,
But this is my advice, twere best
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Like you and me and all the rest?
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
By fond illusions once possest
(This joking I used to protest),
But first permission did request
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
From apprehension of the cost,
By their own horses, not the post
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
On lines invisible are fixt;
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
But with austerity!for you
But, _mtushka_, to Moscow you
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholys claw
Obedient then to Natures law,
A young man motionless he saw,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
The woods, still naked to the view,
She never more his face may view,
My little book. With thee I knew
As in a garden when I grew,
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
To look on life as on a show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Unto a carping world must show
He back as from a sudden blow?
Gazing upon a note below.
To end with him her path below.
They sat, but conversations flow
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
Society he duped enow.
The unaffected traits she now
So thou art wed! I did not know.
Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
Tania, my eldest child, you know
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Tis a scene of romance, I vow!
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The bee forth from his cell of wax
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Impatient waits the close of day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Yet on a frosty winter day
And for a time our course delay,
No senseless fashionable lay
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Tis there that arrant fops display
In the beginning of this lay,
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Another visit hastes to pay.
For follys dues thou hadst to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
Who? Is it that stout general, pray?
His intellect in close array.
But I abandoned their array,
All with urbanity betray,
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Almost became a poet say
Transfixed Onegin mine doth stay.
Horror! had she not better stay
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Deep in the greenwood far away?
And to Onegin far away
But thoughts meander far away
But Summer swiftly fades away
Unto her husband, went away
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Ah! he has gone the other way
Ivan Petrvitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petrvitch just as shabby;
At table she was sitting by
And like a palisade flit by.
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
To consanguineous dinners they
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
What agitation languidly
And turned to leave immediately,
No matter, look immediately.
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
What say you? to the family
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
I would not part with finally;
God save his soul eternally
To all she answers cruelly
By waters shining tranquilly,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
What! Grandison?Yes, certainly!
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
With clouded brow stands silently?
And hebut of him presently
The artifice of villany
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
I thank thee. In thy company,
Hath whiled the roads monotony,
Into the study of the boy
Which in the winter were a joy:
Sang childhoods pastimes and its joy,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
But my Tattianas eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
That Ninas marble symmetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
By the sick ladys gaiety
Lead into good society,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
This, this were true felicity!
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
By his embarrassed dignity
Passed into dull eternity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With us tis quite a novelty
Also my wretched liberty
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
